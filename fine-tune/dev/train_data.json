Furthermore, increasing vacancy concentration can lead to the formation of local temperature gradients and thermal perturbations, which reduces heat transfer and thus affects the thermal conductivity.\n\nIn the study by Zhang et al., it was found that thermal conductivity decreases as the vacancy concentration increases in perfect CNTs in air. This was because vacancy defects in CNTs are responsible for reducing thermal conductivity by causing scattering of heat carriers and creating barriers for heat transfer. The researchers further explored the heat conductivity and transfer coefficient of perfect CNTs in air using noncontact methods and found that it was lower with increasing vacancy concentration."}, {"instruction": "What is the name of the conference where the paper \"Carbon Nanotube Quantum Resistors\" by S.
